# Monte Carlo Tree Search based Space Transfer for Black Box Optimization
Official implementation of NeurIPS'24 paper ["Monte Carlo Tree Search based Space Transfer for Black Box Optimization"](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=T5UfIfmDbq).

This repository contains the Python code for MCTS-Transfer , an search space transfer algorithm for  expensive Black-Box Optimization. The code is implemented based on [LA-MCTS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/LaMCTS/tree/main). Data generation code is based on [RIBBO](https://github.com/songlei00/RIBBO).
